        <p>
            This is a program made in Java using Java Swing with the goal of graphically displaying different sorting algorithms.
            Building this has helped me deepen my understanding of concepts covered in my Data Strcutures and Algorithms course.

        <p>
            My first ever project a checkers game made in Java using Java Swing. Using my limited programming knowledge at the time wanted
            to see if I could recreate a game I would enjoy playing. The result is fully functional and kickstarted my self-learning outside of the classroom.
